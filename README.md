# Hey there! I'm RJ ðŸ‘‹

`Consultant/Digital Enthusiast`

### Iâ€™m a consultant turned digital enthusiast. Right now, I am exploring the trinity of front-end development with React. Recently, Iâ€™ve immersed myself in the fascinating world of ergonomic split keyboards. Currently, I am using a 36-key Fifi Chocofi from Next Keyboard Club, but I plan to transition to a 34-key Ferris Sweep or Urchin for a more minimalist and ergonomic experience. This passion has inspired me to learn the basics of C, enabling me to create my keyboard layouts using QMK and ZMK firmware.

### Learning to code has been challenging at times, but itâ€™s also rewarding. It has introduced me to various programming languages and tools, including JavaScript, C (for custom keyboard layouts), and markup languages like HTML, CSS, and Markdown (for my note-taking app). Iâ€™ve also explored Lua for configuring Neovim, and Iâ€™m excited to see where this journey will take me.

## Why I Made the Leap to a Split Keyboard?
### [Check out my QMK Config here](https://github.com/ryanjayleyva/qmk-fifi-chocofi)

![11B1429A-7A96-4863-BFDE-FD0C30AD59E5_1_201_a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/541db401-17e5-4a73-a8b1-d974b521657e)

### For the longest time, I was content with my Nuphy Air 60 v1 keyboard. Then one day, for no particular reason (letâ€™s just say my inner child took over ðŸ¤£), I upgraded to the v2 model. Life was goodâ€”I had a stylish, compact keyboard that got the job done.

### Everything changed when I started learning to code. At the beginning of my journey into HTML and CSS, I was incredibly motivated and eager to learn. I spent 8 hours a day, consistently, for two straight months, reading documentation, writing code, and practicing. But soon, the enthusiasm came with a cost. I began to notice finger fatigue creeping in. My hands started feeling numb after prolonged typing sessions, my typing speed slowed down significantly, and, worst of all, there was a growing disconnect between my brain and my hands. It felt like my body was actively resisting the work I wanted to do.

### Eventually, I realized I needed to take a break and reevaluate my setup before continuing with JavaScript. If I thought I was spending a lot of time on the computer now, I knew it would only increase once I dived deeper into programming. (Though let me tell youâ€”JavaScript turned out to be so challenging that it had me questioning if coding was even for me ðŸ¤£.)

### Determined to fix the issue, I started looking for ways to make typing more efficient and ergonomic. My first step was switching from the QWERTY layout to Colemak. It took me about one or two weeks to adjust, but the difference was night and day. With Colemak, finger movements are significantly reduced compared to QWERTY, which makes typing much more comfortable. However, I soon realized that while Colemak helped, it wasnâ€™t enough. My fingers still had to travel a lot because of the layout I was used to, especially for common shortcuts and symbols.

### Thatâ€™s when I learned I could customize my keyboard layout. Using VIA software with my Nuphy keyboard, I started experimenting with remapping keys. I discovered the concept of Home Row modsâ€”a feature that allows you to trigger additional functions by holding down keys on the home row. It was a game-changer. Suddenly, I was able to eliminate unnecessary finger movements and reduce strain.

### At first, adapting to this new setup was incredibly frustrating. My brain, accustomed to decades of traditional typing, struggled to adjust. Typing felt slow and awkward, and there were moments when I wanted to revert to my old habits. But I knew that persistence would pay off, and after about three weeks of practice, I finally got comfortable with my new layout. The results were worth itâ€”typing was smoother, more efficient, and far less tiring than before.

### I thought I had solved my ergonomic challenges, but I realized one more issue to address: the staggered layout of traditional keyboards. Designed with typewriters in mind, this layout offsets keys unevenly, forcing hands into unnatural movements. It felt counterintuitive, especially since I was actively trying to minimize hand travel.

### This realization led me to research ergonomic keyboards. My goal was to find a compact keyboard that fit my needs better than the Nuphy Air 60. Initially, I considered the Dygma Defy, which looked promising, but it was expensive and had more keys than needed. Then I discovered the Corne keyboardâ€”a minimalist, split keyboard that was ergonomic and compact. The catch? It required soldering to assemble.

### Thankfully, soldering wasnâ€™t a deal-breaker for me. Iâ€™ve always been passionate about cars, and my experience with air suspension systems taught me a lot about soldering. So, with confidence and excitement, I continued my search.

### Eventually, I found the Fiifi Chocofiâ€”a 36-key split keyboard that seemed perfect. Itâ€™s ultra-minimal, highly ergonomic, and compact enough to suit my needs. For the first time, I felt like I had a setup that supported long coding sessions without compromising comfort or efficiency.

### Iâ€™ll be diving deeper into this experience on my blog, which Iâ€™m currently building. Iâ€™m still deciding between React, Next.js, and Svelte for the blogâ€™s framework, but Iâ€™m leaning toward Svelteâ€”itâ€™s beginner-friendly and easier for someone like me whoâ€™s still learning the ropes.


## Is Upgrading to Air Suspension a Game-Changer for Your Ride?

### No air, no life. Is air suspension worth it? Stay tunedâ€”Iâ€™ll dive into this and more once I finish building my blog. Iâ€™m also planning to cover topics related to my work as a consultant, like working from home, getting paid what you deserve, and much more. And of course, Iâ€™ll share insights about my latest passions: coding, Neovim, keyboards, and beyond.
